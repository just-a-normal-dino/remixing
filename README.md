The Wisdom of the Democratic Crowd: Allowing Collective Intelligence at Massive Scale
===================================================

Main structure of the repository
--------------------

- ABMs/
  This folder contains all the Agent-Based Models (ABMs) developed to simulate the remixing and distributed voting processes. Each subfolder corresponds to a different model (M1, M2, M3), which were independently developed to test the scalability, robustness, and realism of the collective intelligence framework.

- analytical model and analysis/
  Contains the analytical models and numerical analyses used to support the theoretical results in the paper. 

- figure 3/
  This folder includes the code and data for generating Figure 3 of the paper, which compares the performance of the three systems across participant sizes using both analytical and simulation-based methods.

Overview
--------

The project explores how remixing-based peer production, paired with a distributed voting mechanism, can enable democratic participation at national scalesâ€”overcoming coordination costs and participation fatigue typically associated with participatory processes.

Using a combination of:
- Analytical modeling
- Numerical simulations
- Agent-based models

we show that remixing improves the quality of solutions with more participants, and distributed voting can select high-utility options with minimal overhead.
